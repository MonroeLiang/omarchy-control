// Omarchy's launcher, dock and app grid do not look app icons up in the chosen pack. Its
// shell indexes every app icon of every installed pack and keeps the first file it finds
// per name, any SVG before any PNG, starting with ~/.icons. So this keeps one icon per
// launcher in ~/.icons/omarchy-control/apps, taken from the chosen pack, with PNGs wrapped
// in SVG so they come first too. The launcher then shows the pack without any change to
// Omarchy. The idea is Iconic's (github.com/UnderStackDev/omarchy_iconic, MIT).
//
// The layer is derived from the pack and the launchers, so building it is not a change of
// its own and is never in History. Nothing here runs anything or reaches the network.
